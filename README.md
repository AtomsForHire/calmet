[!CAUTION]
I'm still actively converting my personal python script into this CLI utility, so
I haven't tested much just yet.

[!WARNING]
Compilation has been tested on Mac Sequoia 15.5 only, at the moment.
Additionally, it only supports calibration solutions from Hyperdrive (at the
moment).

# Installation

Make sure cargo is installed on your system.
